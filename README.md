## 1) Setup: Your PostgreSQL Stack (Day 1)

- Install PostgreSQL (v15+ or v16+).
  - macOS: `brew install postgresql@16`
  - Windows: EDB installer
  - Linux: apt/yum packages or Docker

- Tools:
  - GUI: DBeaver, TablePlus, pgAdmin
  - CLI: psql (bundled), pgcli (optional auto-complete)
  - Visualize plans: explain.dalibo.com, explain.depesz.com

- Sample databases:
  - dvdrental, Pagila (PostgreSQL port of Sakila), Northwind (PG variant)
  - Real data: Kaggle, IMDb, Stack Overflow, NYC taxi
  - Time-series: GitHub Archive, public COVID datasets

- Quick Docker start:
  ```bash
  docker run --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
  # Connect with DBeaver/pgAdmin to localhost:5432 (user: postgres, db: postgres)
  ```

Tip: Load the dvdrental or Pagila sample and keep a scratch schema for experiments.

  - [ ] Queries: 20+ from basics to advanced windows and JSONB
  - [ ] Performance: partial/expression indexes; materialized views; EXPLAIN before/after
  - [ ] Ops: backup/restore test; RLS for multi-tenant schema; simple replication

## 6) Common Pitfalls (Postgres‚ÄëSpecific)

- Overusing CTEs as ‚Äúoptimization fences‚Äù (PG12+ can inline; use MATERIALIZED if you need a fence)
- Using SERIAL instead of modern GENERATED AS IDENTITY
- Confusing timestamp vs timestamptz (always prefer timestamptz unless you truly need ‚Äúnaive‚Äù time)
- Ignoring ANALYZE: stale stats lead to bad plans; schedule ANALYZE after big loads
- Too many low-selectivity indexes; forgetting partial or expression indexes
- Missing COLLATION/ICU considerations for case/locale-sensitive sorts/searches
- Using DISTINCT to mask join errors; fix joins or use DISTINCT ON purposefully
- Large DELETEs without batching/VACUUM; consider partitioning or soft-deletes when appropriate

---

## 7) Suggested Timeline Summary

- Weeks 0‚Äì5: Querying mastery (joins, aggregates, CTEs, windows)
- Weeks 6‚Äì8: Modeling, constraints, transactions, indexing
- Weeks 9‚Äì10: Extensions, views, stored code, JSONB, FTS
- Weeks 11‚Äì12: Admin/scaling fundamentals, partitioning, replication, capstone polish

---

## 8) Tailor This Plan for You

Share:
- Your target role (data vs backend vs DBA)
- Time commitment per week and your target date
- OS and whether you prefer Docker

I‚Äôll generate a focused 2‚Äì3 week checklist with exercises, a ready-to-load dvdrental/Pagila schema, and a set of practice questions matched to your goals.

### Quick PostgreSQL Cheatsheet

- Identity column:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    email CITEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
  );
  ```
- Upsert:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users(email) VALUES ('a@b.com')
  ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET email = EXCLUDED.email;
  ```
- JSONB index for search:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX users_profile_gin ON users USING GIN (profile jsonb_path_ops);
  ```
- Trigram index for ILIKE:
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
  CREATE INDEX users_email_trgm ON users USING GIN (email gin_trgm_ops);
  -- speeds up WHERE email ILIKE '%abc%'
  ```
- View + materialized view:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW v_daily AS
  SELECT date_trunc('day', created_at)::date AS d, count(*) AS c FROM events GROUP BY 1;

  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_daily AS
  SELECT date_trunc('day', created_at)::date AS d, count(*) AS c FROM events GROUP BY 1;
  -- Later:
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_daily;
  ```

Happy querying with PostgreSQL! üöÄ
